# Home Security with Face Recognition

![name-of-you-image](https://github.com/ysinha24/Home-Security-Face-Recognition/blob/master/DoorRecognitionIOT.jpg?raw=true)

This Project uses multiple ESP32-CAM microcontrollers as an IOT device that detects an individual, takes a picture, and stores the images on a local MySQL database using APIs. These images are further processed using AWS Lambda cloud computing to detect known faces using OpenCV and premade machine learning architectures. The system also sends a real-time SMS text for any unauthorized people, and also analyzes who enters at each time and provides a weekly overview of occurrences.
